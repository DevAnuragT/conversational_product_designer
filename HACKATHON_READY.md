- Show real-time suggestions appearing
- Click a suggestion to add it
- Generate with enhanced prompt

**Explore Variations** (30 seconds)
- Hover over hero section
- Click "Variations" button
- Show 7 different variations side-by-side
- Click "Surprise Me" for random selection
- Select a variation and apply it

**Edit & Refine** (20 seconds)
- Hover over component
- Click "Edit"
- Change headline in split-screen editor
- See live preview
- Save changes

**Export & Deploy** (20 seconds)
- Click "Export Code"
- Choose React format
- Download ZIP file
- Show it contains working code with package.json, README, etc.

**Save & Manage** (10 seconds)
- Click "Projects" sidebar
- Show saved projects
- Load a previous design

### 3. The Impact (30 seconds)
"Now you can go from idea to deployed landing page in minutes. Start with professional templates, get AI-powered suggestions, explore design variations, edit every detail, and export working code. This isn't just a demo—it's a complete landing page builder."
